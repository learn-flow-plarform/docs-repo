## 1. Overview

This document defines all user stories required to bring MindFlow from its audited state (**41/100 production readiness**) to a secure, reliable, deployable platform.

The features are organized around **delivery increments** rather than technical layers:

1. **F01 — AI Communication & Job Infrastructure** — replaces direct HTTP proxying to the Python AI service with an asynchronous RabbitMQ architecture, simultaneously removing the audit's worst finding (unauthenticated Python API) and the missing queue/reliability weakness
2. **F02–F05 — AI features** (Planner, Coach, Evaluator, Search & Ingestion) — migrate each agent onto the RabbitMQ job framework and eliminate prompt-injection vulnerabilities
3. **F06 — Authentication & Security** — resolves remaining P0/P1 security and crash risks (OTP, refresh token, async handlers, internal auth, ReDoS, uploads)
4. **F07–F09 — Study, Gamification, Analytics & Performance** — reliability and scalability (async side effects, indexes, N+1, aggregation, base64 storage)
5. **F10 — Testing & Quality** — makes the test suite actually prove the platform works (fake integration tests removed, E2E unblocked, contract + security tests)
6. **F11 — Infrastructure & Deployment** — blocking CI security, hardening, staging, deployment
7. **F12 — UX & Frontend Quality** — product friction fixes
8. **F13 — Observability & Disaster Recovery** — monitoring, alerting, backups, DR
9. **F14 — Bloom Competency Engine** — revised Bloom taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001) as a two-dimensional competency model: learning objectives classified by cognitive process × knowledge type, evidence-based mastery estimation per (topic × level), and personalized plans that target the weakest competencies

The first feature (**F01**) is the shared foundation for every AI feature and is a hard prerequisite for F02–F05.

### Team

| Developer | Primary responsibility |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Dev A** | Backend / Core platform (Node services, MongoDB, contracts) |
| **Dev B** | AI / Python / AI infrastructure (agents, workers, LLM security) |
| **Dev C** | Frontend / QA / DevOps (React, Playwright, Docker, CI/CD) |

Developers are not locked to one layer. During a feature, two developers can work on different sides of the same feature.

### Story Format

All stories follow the sprint backlog format:

```
ID | User Story | Day | Assignee | Domain | Type | Priority | Est.h | Story Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Dependencies
```

### Sequencing Principle

- **F01 (RabbitMQ + contracts) first** — every AI feature depends on it
- **One vertical slice before full migration** — one complete AI operation must travel Node → RabbitMQ → Python → RabbitMQ → Node before migrating the rest
- **Ingestion before AI intelligence** — you can't analyze what you haven't collected
- **Security before feature growth** — F06 completes while AI features migrate
- **Testing is a feature** — F10 runs in parallel from Sprint 1 and validates every other feature
- **Refactoring and UX last** — only after the system is operationally stable
- **Competency before personalization claims** — F14 turns "personalized plan" from marketing into a measured feedback loop; it lands after ingestion + evaluation produce evidence

### Priority Model

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Critical** | Production blocker (audit P0) |
| **High** | Important before production (audit P1) |
| **Medium** | Production maturity (audit P2) |
| **Low** | Enhancement / quality of life (audit P3) |

---

## 2. F01 — AI Communication & Job Infrastructure (AI-COM)

### Epic: As a Platform, I want AI communication to be asynchronous via a secured, reliable RabbitMQ job bus so that the Python AI service is no longer exposed as a client-facing HTTP API and every AI job is idempotent, traceable and retried.

**Priority:** Critical
**Sprint:** 1
**Owners:** Dev A + Dev B + Dev C

This is the shared foundation for every AI feature. The current architecture has the Node `ai-orchestrator-service` proxying directly to the Python AI service over HTTP, and the Python service has **no authentication** (audit §7.1, Critical). Replacing direct HTTP with an authenticated, network-isolated RabbitMQ job bus resolves the audit's #1 finding and its missing-queue reliability finding (§5.5) in one architectural change.

#### AI-COM-01 — RabbitMQ Infrastructure

**User Story:**
As a Platform Engineer, I want RabbitMQ provisioned in the Docker Compose stack with credentials, vhost, persistent storage and a health check so that AI jobs can be transported reliably.

**Domain:** Infrastructure
**Type:** Infra
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 4
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 1

**Dependencies:** None

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- RabbitMQ container added to both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Credentials supplied via environment variables (`RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER`, `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS`) with no weak in-file defaults
- A dedicated vhost (e.g., `mindflow`) configured for AI traffic
- Persistent volume mounted for queue data (`rabbitmq_data`)
- Container health check defined (`rabbitmq-diagnostics -q ping`) and wired into compose `depends_on`
- Management UI disabled on public exposure; only reachable inside the internal network
- Port `5672` bound to the internal Docker network only (not `0.0.0.0` on the host)

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §9.1/§9.2 Docker posture; §7.11 unauthenticated Redis/RabbitMQ risk
- Use the `rabbitmq:3-management` image only in dev; plain `rabbitmq:3` in prod
- Apply CPU/memory limits in prod compose (mirrors existing per-service limits)

---

#### AI-COM-02 — AI Message Contract

**User Story:**
As a Platform Engineer, I want a versioned AI job message envelope with idempotency, correlation and tracing fields so that every AI operation is uniquely identifiable end-to-end.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 1

**Dependencies:** None

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Define a canonical JSON envelope in the shared Node package (`shared/`) and as a Pydantic model in the Python service:

```json
{
  "messageId": "uuid",
  "correlationId": "uuid",
  "type": "study.plan.generate",
  "version": "1",
  "userId": "user-id",
  "requestId": "request-id",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-19T08:00:00Z",
  "payload": {}
}
```

- Field semantics enforced:
  - `messageId` → consumer idempotency (deduplication key)
  - `correlationId` → connects request → AI result
  - `type` → identifies the AI operation
  - `version` → future schema evolution
  - `userId` → AI knows whose operation this is (never taken from body)
  - `requestId` → distributed tracing
  - `timestamp` → observability / debugging
- Both Node and Python validate the envelope schema on publish and on consume
- Invalid messages are rejected before entering business logic
- Contract is documented in a shared markdown file referenced by both codebases

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §7.1 (AI API unauthenticated) — `userId` must come from the authenticated Node context, never from a client body
- This contract is the single synchronization point for the whole feature

---

#### AI-COM-03 — AI Result Contract

**User Story:**
As a Platform Engineer, I want a versioned AI result event envelope so that the orchestrator can correlate each result to its originating request and persist/return it correctly.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 2
**Day:** 1

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Result envelope contains: `messageId` (echo), `correlationId`, `requestId`, `type`, `status` (`completed` | `failed`), `payload`, `error` (if failed), `timestamp`
- On failure, the result includes a sanitized error (no stack traces, no DB connection strings)
- Result contract is versioned identically to the request contract
- Both Node and Python validate the result envelope schema
- Definition of "terminal" vs "retryable" failure is encoded (see AI-COM-06)

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §7.5 error leakage via `str(e)` in Python routers and `proxyBuilder.js`
- The result contract allows the Node orchestrator to persist job state (AI-COM-07)

---

#### AI-COM-04 — Node RabbitMQ Publisher

**User Story:**
As an AI Orchestrator developer, I want a shared Node publisher that validates and publishes AI job messages and consumes result events so that services publish consistent, traceable jobs.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 4
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-01, AI-COM-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Shared publisher module (`shared/ai-messaging/`) with a single `publishAiJob(type, userId, payload)` API
- Publisher enforces the AI-COM-02 envelope schema before publishing
- Connection lifecycle managed: reconnect with exponential backoff, heartbeat
- Publisher is injected into `ai-orchestrator-service`; no direct HTTP calls to the Python AI service remain for new jobs
- `correlationId`/`requestId` generated or propagated from the incoming HTTP request
- Publish failure does not silently drop the job: returns a recoverable error to the caller
- One unit test proving a valid job is published and an invalid envelope is rejected

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §5.3 duplicate `buildInternalHeaders`/proxy patterns to be replaced by messaging
- Reuses the AI-COM-02 contract as the single source of truth

---

#### AI-COM-05 — Python RabbitMQ Consumer Framework

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want a shared `BaseAIWorker` consumer framework in Python so that all five AI agents reuse one connection, validation and ACK/NACK pipeline instead of five independent consumers.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-01, AI-COM-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `BaseAIWorker` provides: connect, declare exchange/queues, consume, validate envelope, dispatch to handler, ACK/NACK, graceful shutdown
- Concrete workers inherit it:

```
BaseAIWorker
   ├── PlannerWorker
   ├── CoachWorker
   ├── EvaluatorWorker
   ├── SearchWorker
   └── IngestionWorker
```

- Envelope validated against the AI-COM-02 Pydantic schema before dispatch
- Message ACKed only after successful processing; NACKed with `requeue=false` for retryable failures (per AI-COM-06)
- Duplicate `messageId` rejected via idempotency store (AI-COM-08)
- Worker prefetch limit configured (e.g., prefetch=1 per queue) to bound memory
- Graceful shutdown drains in-flight messages on SIGTERM
- One integration test: consuming a fixture message runs the correct handler

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §5.2/§5.5 three different LLM clients and 8+ `DatabaseService()` instantiations — the framework should own the single shared DB client
- Audit: §8.3 blocking Python event loop — handlers run LLM/ML work off the main loop (see SP08 refactor, kept out of this sprint's scope)

---

#### AI-COM-06 — Retry / Dead-Letter Queue

**User Story:**
As a Platform Engineer, I want automatic retry with exponential backoff and dead-letter queues so that transient AI failures recover without losing jobs.

**Domain:** Infrastructure
**Type:** Infra
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 3

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-05

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Retry policy defined: max retry count (e.g., 3), exponential backoff (e.g., 1s → 4s → 16s)
- Retry queues configured per AI operation with per-message TTL
- Dead-letter exchange and per-operation DLQ configured (`ai.dlx`, `ai.<op>.dlq`)
- Messages exceeding max retries land in the DLQ with the failure reason attached
- DLQ consumers can replay messages (with a manual tool or admin endpoint)
- Retryable vs terminal failure classification implemented (network/timeout → retry; schema/validation → DLQ immediately)
- RabbitMQ queue monitoring endpoint exposes per-queue depth and DLQ depth

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §5.5 fire-and-forget persistence — this is the reliability backbone
- Uses the durable topology from AI-COM-01; TTL applies only to retry queues

---

#### AI-COM-07 — AI Job Persistence

**User Story:**
As an AI Orchestrator developer, I want AI jobs persisted with an explicit state machine so that the API can return job status and results can be retrieved after the fact.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 2–3

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New `AiJob` model (study-service or shared) with fields: `jobId`, `type`, `userId`, `requestId`, `correlationId`, `status`, `result`, `error`, `attempts`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- States: `PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED` / `FAILED`, plus `RETRYING`
- State transitions enforced (invalid transitions rejected)
- Job creation returns `202 Accepted` with the `jobId` immediately
- Result correlation: when a result event arrives, the job is updated via `correlationId`
- Jobs are queryable by user: `GET /api/v1/ai/jobs/{jobId}` and `GET /api/v1/ai/jobs?userId=...`
- Indexes on `jobId`, `userId + createdAt`, `correlationId`
- TTL/cleanup policy for completed jobs defined (e.g., 30 days)

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §5.5 queue absence; §8.1 no caching/hot-read issues — this model also enables polling UIs (PLAN-09)
- Replaces the current synchronous proxy contract of `ai-orchestrator-service`

---

#### AI-COM-08 — Idempotency

**User Story:**
As a Platform Engineer, I want duplicate AI messages processed exactly once so that retries and client retransmissions never double-pay LLM calls or duplicate side effects.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 4

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-05, AI-COM-07

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Consumer deduplicates by `messageId` (Redis SETNX or MongoDB unique index + state check)
- A duplicate message is ACKed without re-running the handler
- Idempotency keys are stored with TTL (e.g., 24h) to bound store growth
- Side effects triggered by a job (XP awards, plan saves, notification) are also idempotent (see GAME-06)
- Test: publishing the same message twice runs the handler once

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §8.3 fire-and-forget XP/streak side effects — the idempotency pattern here becomes the template for GAME-06

---

#### AI-COM-09 — AI Network Isolation

**User Story:**
As a Security Engineer, I want the Python AI service reachable only from inside the internal Docker network so that it cannot be reached from the browser or the public internet.

**Domain:** Infrastructure
**Type:** Security
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 2
**Story Points:** 2
**Day:** 3

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Python AI container publishes no host ports in `docker-compose.yml` / `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Service is reachable only via the internal `study-partner-network`
- Nginx does not proxy any `/ai` path to the Python service
- No CORS configuration exposes AI endpoints to browser origins
- Network-level rule verified by an integration/security test that an external request cannot reach `:8000`
- Documentation updated: `❌ Internet → Python AI`, `❌ Browser → Python AI`, `✅ Node → RabbitMQ → Python AI`

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §7.1 (Critical — no auth on Python AI API). Network isolation is the architectural fix; a defensive `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` check may remain on the (now unused) HTTP entrypoint until it is removed
- Keep the FastAPI app alive only for the RabbitMQ consumer bootstrap and health checks

---

#### AI-COM-10 — Communication Integration Test

**User Story:**
As a QA Engineer, I want one end-to-end test where a real AI job travels Node → RabbitMQ → Python AI → RabbitMQ → Node so that the foundation is proven before any feature migration begins.

**Domain:** Testing
**Type:** Test
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 4
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 5

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-04, AI-COM-05, AI-COM-07

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test publishes a fixture job (`study.plan.generate`) via the Node publisher
- Asserts the Python worker consumes and executes (with mocked LLM)
- Asserts the result event is published and the orchestrator updates the `AiJob` to `COMPLETED`
- Asserts `correlationId`/`requestId` are consistent across the whole round trip
- Asserts a deliberately NACKed message ends in the DLQ after max retries
- Test runs in CI against a real RabbitMQ service container
- **Feature Definition of Done:** `Node → RabbitMQ → Python AI → RabbitMQ → Node` works with a real AI request

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §10.2 no real end-to-end test exists anywhere
- This is the vertical-slice gate: do not start F02–F05 migration until it passes

---

## 3. F02 — AI Planner (PLAN)

### Epic: As a User, I want to generate personalized study plans through the new RabbitMQ job pipeline so that plan generation is asynchronous, secure against prompt injection and reliably persisted.

**Priority:** Critical
**Sprint:** 1–2
**Owners:** Dev A (orchestrator/API) + Dev B (planner agent) + Dev C (frontend/QA)

The planner currently interpolates user-controlled `goal`/`concepts` directly into an LLM prompt (`llm_decomposer_real.py:30–45`) and has a `SimpleGoalDecomposer` fallback. This feature migrates it onto the job bus and hardens it.

#### PLAN-01 — Planner RabbitMQ Consumer

   **User Story:**
   As an AI engineer, I want the planner to consume `study.plan.generate` jobs through `PlannerWorker` so that plan generation runs inside the job bus.

   **Domain:** AI
   **Type:** Feature
   **Priority:** Critical
   **Estimated Hours:** 3
   **Story Points:** 3
   **Day:** 1

   **Dependencies:** AI-COM-05

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - `PlannerWorker` extends `BaseAIWorker`
   - Handler invoked with validated envelope payload
   - ACK on success, NACK per AI-COM-06 policy on failure
   - Existing `PlannerAgent` invoked from the worker with the payload
   - No direct HTTP exposure for planning remains

   ---

#### PLAN-02 — Planner Input Schema

**User Story:**
As a Backend engineer, I want the planner request payload validated by a strict schema (with length limits) so that malformed or oversized input never reaches the LLM.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 2
**Story Points:** 2
**Day:** 1

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pydantic `PlannerRequest` model defines: `goal` (1–500 chars), `concepts` (list of 0–50, each ≤ 100 chars), optional `courseId`, optional `deadline`
- Schema mirrored in the Node envelope payload validation
- Over-length or malformed payloads rejected at the orchestrator before publish
- `userId` taken only from the authenticated context, never from the payload

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §7.2 prompt injection (planner), §2.4 AI service input validation gaps

---

#### PLAN-03 — Planner Prompt Isolation

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want user content isolated from instructions in the planner prompt so that prompt injection is neutralized.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Security
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 1–2

**Dependencies:** PLAN-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User-provided `goal`/`concepts` wrapped in unambiguous delimiters and marked as untrusted data
- System instructions separated from user content (role separation)
- Instruction-override phrasing ("ignore previous instructions", etc.) treated as data, not commands
- No executable instructions derived from LLM output
- Prompt hardened against the audit attack surface in `llm_decomposer_real.py:30–45`

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §7.2 — highest-risk LLM path besides search
- Reusable hardening approach shared with COACH-03/EVAL-03/SEARCH-03 (extract to a shared `prompt_guard` util)

---

#### PLAN-04 — Planner Output Schema

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want the planner LLM output parsed into a strict, typed schema so that downstream code never trusts free-form LLM text.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** PLAN-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pydantic `PlannerOutput` schema: tasks with `title`, `description`, `duration_minutes`, `order`, optional `topicId`
- Tasks MAY carry optional `objectiveId` + `targetBloomLevel` (F14 BLOOM-10): when competency data is available, generated plans target specific learning objectives
- Output parsing via structured extraction (JSON with schema validation)
- Parsing failures produce a sanitized validation error for the job result

---

#### PLAN-05 — Planner Output Validation

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want planner outputs validated (required fields, ranges, evidence) before persistence so that hallucinated or malformed plans are rejected.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** PLAN-04

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Reject outputs with missing required fields, durations ≤ 0 or > 480 minutes, empty task lists
- Confidence/evidence check: every task must trace to an input concept or course content
- One retry with a "please follow the schema" correction prompt; then FAILED with sanitized reason
- Rejected outputs logged with full LLM response for debugging (no user data beyond job context)

**Technical Notes:**
- Audit: §7.2; mirrors HDIE-09 validation pipeline pattern from the reference backlog

---

#### PLAN-06 — Planner Retry / Fallback

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want planner failures to retry with backoff and fall back to the deterministic decomposer so that users still get a plan during LLM outages.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 3

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-06

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- LLM timeout/quota failures flow through the retry/DLQ policy (AI-COM-06)
- After retries, fall back to `SimpleGoalDecomposer` and mark the job `COMPLETED` with `fallbackUsed: true`
- Fallback result still passes PLAN-05 validation
- User-facing result includes a note that a simpler decomposition was used

---

#### PLAN-07 — Planner Result Persistence

**User Story:**
As a Backend engineer, I want completed plan results persisted to the study database so that the API and frontend can retrieve them.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 3

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-07

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- On `COMPLETED`, the orchestrator saves the validated plan to the `Plan` collection
- Duplicate correlation (`messageId`/`correlationId`) cannot create duplicate plans
- Job status updated to `COMPLETED` with result reference
- Failure path leaves no partial plan documents

---

#### PLAN-08 — Planner API Integration

**User Story:**
As a Backend engineer, I want the plan-generation API to create a job and expose its status so that the frontend can poll or subscribe.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 4

**Dependencies:** PLAN-07

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `POST /api/v1/plans/generate` returns `202 { jobId }` (no synchronous LLM wait)
- `GET /api/v1/plans/jobs/{jobId}` returns status + result when ready
- Existing synchronous plan route either removed or routed through the job path
- 401/403 preserved through the orchestrator (auth stays at gateway/service layer)

---

#### PLAN-09 — Planner Frontend Async State

**User Story:**
As a User, I want the plan-generation UI to show job progress (pending/processing/completed/failed) with retry so that I understand and can recover from async generation.

**Domain:** Frontend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 4

**Dependencies:** PLAN-08

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `StudyPlanner` page triggers job creation and polls `GET /api/v1/plans/jobs/{jobId}`
- Loading, progress, completed, and failed states rendered (with the shared skeleton/empty-state components from UX-07)
- Failed jobs show a "Retry" action that creates a new job
- No hard refresh required to see the result

---

#### PLAN-10 — Planner E2E Tests

**User Story:**
As a QA Engineer, I want an end-to-end test covering plan generation through the real job bus so that the planner feature is proven.

**Domain:** Testing
**Type:** Test
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 5

**Dependencies:** PLAN-08

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Playwright test: authenticated user → create plan → job completes (LLM mocked) → plan visible in UI
- Runs against the real API + RabbitMQ with only external LLM mocked
- Negative test: invalid input shows validation error without creating a job

---

#### PLAN-11 — Prompt-Injection Tests

**User Story:**
As a Security Engineer, I want regression tests that malicious planner inputs are treated as data so that prompt-injection fixes stay fixed.

**Domain:** Testing
**Type:** Test
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 5

**Dependencies:** PLAN-05

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test suite covering: instruction-override attempts, goal containing "ignore previous instructions", concept containing script/command payloads, extremely long inputs
- All tests assert the planner output schema/behavior is unaffected by the injection payloads
- Tests run in Python pytest against the planner with mocked LLM responses

---

## 4. F03 — AI Coach (COACH)

### Epic: As a User, I want real-time coaching nudges delivered through the job bus with hardened prompts so that coaching is reliable and cannot be manipulated by user input.

**Priority:** High
**Sprint:** 2
**Owners:** Dev A (API) + Dev B (coach agent) + Dev C (QA)

The coach currently embeds the full `CoachInput` dump into the Gemini prompt (`llm_decider.py:218–224`) and uses a separate LLM client from the other agents.

**Scope (Sprint 2):** reliable, hardened nudge delivery through the job bus.
**Expansion (Sprint 3+):** the coach grows into an active learning companion —
it watches live session stats, knows which courses and subjects the user
studies, reads emotional state from ML models, and can trigger the reschedule
agent to change the plan when a nudge is not enough.

---

#### COACH-01 — Coach RabbitMQ Consumer

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want the coach to consume `study.coach.nudge` jobs through `CoachWorker` so that coaching runs inside the job bus.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 3

### Coach expansion beyond nudges (Sprint 3)

Building on the nudge pipeline (COACH-01–12), the coach becomes an active
learning companion. New capabilities, implemented feature by feature after the
nudge path is live:

1. **Session stats** — coach sees live session statistics (progress, time on
   task, recent completions, streak) so nudges reflect actual behaviour.
2. **Course & subject awareness** — coach knows which courses and subjects the
   user studies, so nudges reference the correct domain and vocabulary.
3. **Emotion detection** — an ML emotion adapter feeds the student's emotional
   state (frustration, stress, boredom, …) into the coach instead of a
   hardcoded default.
4. **Reschedule agent** — when a nudge is not enough, the coach triggers the
   reschedule agent to change the plan inside the job bus.

---

#### COACH-13 — Session Stats Feed ✅ done

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want the coach to receive live session statistics (progress, time on task, recent completions, streak) so that nudges are grounded in the student's actual in-session behaviour.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 1

**Status:** DONE (2026-08-31, branch `coach-13`)

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** COACH-13

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `EmotionAdapter` produces `affective_state` (engaged, frustrated, stressed, bored, confident) + confidence, mirroring the focus/fatigue adapters
- `CoachInput.affective_state` populated from signals, removing the hardcoded `engaged` constant in `services/ai_orchestrator/orchestrator.py`

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** COACH-01

**Status:** DONE (2026-08-31, branches `coach-16` on `study-partner-ai` + `study-partner-api`)

## 5. F04 — AI Evaluator (EVAL)

### Epic: As a User, I want Socratic evaluations to run through the job bus with evidence-grounded, schema-validated scoring so that mastery assessment is reliable and immune to prompt injection.

**Priority:** High
**Sprint:** 2
**Owners:** Dev A (API) + Dev B (evaluator agent) + Dev C (QA)

The evaluator currently passes raw `student_answer` into the analysis prompt (`evaluator_agent.py:414–421`) and keeps sessions in memory + Mongo.

---

#### EVAL-01 — Evaluator Worker ✅ done

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want the evaluator to consume `study.eval.step` jobs through `EvaluatorWorker` so that evaluation steps run inside the job bus.

**Domain:** AI

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 2
**Story Points:** 2
**Day:** 1

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-02, EVAL-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `EvaluationRequest` schema: camelCase wire fields `sessionId`, `step` (int ≥ 1), `studentAnswer` (1–5000 chars), `contextId`; `extra="forbid"`; validated in `EvaluatorWorker` (malformed → terminal)
- [ ] Objective targeting (`objectiveId` → bloomLevel + knowledgeType) — deferred to **EVAL-02b** (F14/BLOOM dependent)
- [x] Session state rehydration: the worker loads prior turns from the state store (in-memory sessions from `evaluator_agent.py` are not reliable across restarts)
- [x] `userId` from authenticated context only

---

#### EVAL-02b — Evaluation Objective Targeting

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want evaluation requests to optionally target a learning objective so that a session's Bloom level and knowledge type shape the questions and scoring.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** (after F14)

**Dependencies:** EVAL-02, F14/BLOOM (learning objectives)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `EvaluationRequest` carries optional `objectiveId`
- When present, the objective's `bloomLevel` + `knowledgeType` (F14 model) are loaded server-side and carried as evaluation context
- Session targets the objective's Bloom level for question depth and demonstrates the resulting level on mastery
- `objectiveId`/`targetBloomLevel` join the persisted step result for BLOOM-08 competency updates

---

#### EVAL-03 — Prompt Hardening ✅ done

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want student answers and context isolated in evaluation prompts so that students cannot inject scoring instructions.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Security
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** EVAL-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `student_answer` wrapped as untrusted data (audit finding at `evaluator_agent.py:414–421`)
- [x] Instructions about scoring/behavior separated from user content
- [x] "Give me 1.0" style injections treated as data
- [x] Reuses shared `prompt_guard` utility

---

#### EVAL-04 — Output Schema ✅ done

**User Story:**

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** EVAL-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `EvaluationOutput` schema: 5 dimension scores (concept coverage, logical coherence, causal reasoning, error awareness, specificity), each 0.0–1.0, plus `mastery_score`, `next_question`, `session_status`
- [x] Bloom fields (F14): `targetBloomLevel` (echoed from the objective) + `demonstratedBloomLevel` — the cognitive operation the answer actually shows; the two MAY differ
- [x] Structured extraction + validation
- [x] Out-of-range values rejected

---

#### EVAL-05 — Evidence Grounding ✅ done

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want evaluator scoring to reference evidence from the student's answer so that scores are auditable and hallucination-resistant.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 3

**Dependencies:** EVAL-03

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Each dimension score includes an evidence quote (max 200 chars) from the answer
- [x] Evidence items structured as `{dimension, quote}` so they can be reused directly as competency `evidence[]` entries in the F14 profile store
- [x] Scores without evidence quotes are rejected at validation
- [x] Guessing detection retained and reported in the output
- [x] Mastery scoring formula retained with its smoothing guard (reused by BLOOM-07's estimator)

---

#### EVAL-06 — Validation / Rejection ✅ done

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want malformed or ungrounded evaluation outputs rejected before persistence so that bad scores never reach the UI.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 3

**Dependencies:** EVAL-04

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Reject missing fields, out-of-range scores, missing evidence quotes, incoherent question
- [x] One correction retry, then FAILED with sanitized reason
- [x] Rejection logged with full LLM response for debugging

---

#### EVAL-07 — Retry / Fallback

**User Story:**
As a Platform Engineer, I want evaluation jobs retried per policy so that transient LLM failures don't lose a session step.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 4

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-06

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Timeout/quota failures → retry/DLQ policy
- [x] Session remains in the state store across retries (state machine must be retry-safe)
- [x] Idempotent by `messageId`: replaying a step does not double-count

> **✅ done (EVAL-07):** Implemented on `eval-07` (`dee6754`). Validate-then-mutate session state so a transient LLM failure surfaces as `RetryableError` before mutation; the AI-COM-06 worker policy retries/DLQs, and a retried step never double-counts attempts/answers. `GeminiClient.generate(raise_on_error=True)` propagates transient errors; non-transient failures keep the defensive local-scoring fallback. 12 tests in `tests/test_evaluator_retry.py`.

#### EVAL-08 — Result Persistence

**User Story:**
As a Backend engineer, I want evaluation results persisted per session step so that the API and frontend can resume sessions.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 4

**Dependencies:** AI-COM-07

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Each step's score + next question persisted to Mongo
- [x] `demonstratedBloomLevel` + `objectiveId` (when present) persisted per step — the raw feed for BLOOM-08 competency updates
- [x] **Future extension (KG-RAG-09):** evaluation results will also trigger student mastery updates in the knowledge graph (StudentMastery node)
- [x] Session state recoverable after service restart (removes the in-memory-only risk)
- [x] Idempotent by `correlationId`

> **✅ done (EVAL-08):** Cross-repo — the Python agents ONLY publish `ai.results` events (never write Mongo); the Node backend is the sole writer. `study-partner-ai/eval-08` (`569f31c`) enriched the published payload into a clean per-step record (`sessionId`, `step`, `demonstratedBloomLevel`, optional `objectiveId`); `study-partner-api/eval-08` (`ccb50f0`) added the `EvalResult` model (`eval_results`, unique `correlationId` upsert → idempotent, `sessionId`+`step` index for resume, `demonstratedBloomLevel` index for the BLOOM-08 feed) and wires `jobResultConsumer` to persist it. Session rehydration across restarts is carried by the `evaluation_output` + per-step history.

#### EVAL-09 — API Integration

**User Story:**
As a Backend engineer, I want the evaluation API to create jobs and return status so that the Socratic UI can poll for steps.

**Domain:** Backend

**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 5

**Dependencies:** EVAL-08

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `POST /api/v1/eval/step` returns `202 { jobId }`
- [x] `GET /api/v1/eval/jobs/{jobId}` returns status + step result
- [x] Frontend `SocraticEvaluation` component consumes the async API

✅ done — PRs awaited (study-partner-api `eval-09@b420bca`, study-partner-web `eval-09@b1ee95e`). Node: `routes/eval.js` POST `/api/v1/eval/step` (validate eval payload → `AiJob.createPending` → `publishAiJob('study.eval.step')` → 202 `{ jobId, status, correlationId, sessionId, step, poll }`; rolls back PENDING job on publish failure) + GET `/api/v1/eval/jobs/:jobId` (owner-scoped, eval-type only) mounted under `/api/v1/eval` with `authenticate` + AI rate limit on the step; 9 route tests (`eval-routes.test.js`). Web: `SocraticEvaluation` now polls the job API (`submitEvalStep`/`getEvalJob`) instead of legacy sync endpoints — client-generated `sessionId`, step increments per answer, `taskTitle` as `contextId`, CONTINUE walks `next_question`, mastery_confirmed/failed ends; 4 vitest tests.

---

#### EVAL-10 — E2E Tests

**User Story:**
As a QA Engineer, I want an end-to-end evaluation test so that the Socratic flow is proven through the job bus.

**Domain:** Testing
**Type:** Test
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 5

**Dependencies:** EVAL-09

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Playwright: user answers question → eval job completes (LLM mocked) → next question displayed → session completes with mastery score
- Negative: submitting an empty answer shows validation feedback

✅ done — PR awaited (study-partner-web `eval-10@606c699`, PR #4 → `AI-evaluator`). Playwright `e2e/eval-e2e.spec.js` (2 green tests) proves the async job flow at the API boundary (LLM mocked via `POST /api/v1/eval/step` → `GET /api/v1/eval/jobs/:jobId`), no backend/broker required: seed login (`auth-storage`) + seeded `sessionStore` into the full task view → MARK COMPLETE (mocked task-complete) opens the Socratic card → step 1 CONTINUE shows `next_question` (Q2) → step 2 `mastery_confirmed` 0.9 → "Evaluation Passed" + 90%. E2E surfaced two real bugs fixed in this story: `aliveRef` died under StrictMode double-mount (submits silently dropped) and the card unmounted on `onComplete` in the same batch so the mastery result never painted. `SocraticEvaluation` vitest: 7 passing incl. a StrictMode regression. eslint override disables testing-library `prefer-screen-queries` for `e2e/` (Playwright locators).

## 15. F14 — Bloom Competency Engine (BLOOM)

### Epic: As a User, I want my platform to model WHAT kind of thinking I demonstrate (revised Bloom taxonomy, Anderson & Krathwohl 2001) so that mastery is measured as evidence-based cognitive competency per topic — not a single quiz percentage — and my study plan targets exactly where I am weakest.

**Priority:** High
**Sprint:** 3–4
**Owners:** Dev B (AI/estimator) + Dev A (models/API) + Dev C (UI/QA)

The revised taxonomy classifies learning along TWO dimensions: six cognitive processes (Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze → Evaluate → Create) and four knowledge types (factual, conceptual, procedural, metacognitive). A question HAS a Bloom level; a student's answer DEMONSTRATES a level that may differ. The engine maintains a competency profile keyed `(userId × topic × knowledgeType × bloomLevel)` with score, confidence and evidence — never a naive "% correct → level" mapping.

Reference: `docs/education/bloom-taxonomy.md` (BLOOM-DOC).

---

#### BLOOM-01 — Shared Taxonomy Constants

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want the taxonomy enums and verb maps defined once and mirrored across Node and Python with a parity fixture so that no service can drift from the canonical model.

**Domain:** Full-stack
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 1

**Dependencies:** none (F01 done)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sealed enums: `BLOOM_LEVELS = [remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create]` (ordered), `KNOWLEDGE_TYPES = [factual, conceptual, procedural, metacognitive]`
- Action-verb map per level (Waterloo mapping: Remember→Define/List, Understand→Explain/Summarize, Apply→Solve/Implement, Analyze→Compare/Diagnose, Evaluate→Justify/Critique, Create→Design/Compose)
- Node module `shared/bloom/taxonomy.js` + Python mirror `bloom/taxonomy.py`
- Shared fixture `docs/contracts/bloom-fixture.json`; parity BLOOM-01 — Shared Taxonomy Constantstests on both sides (pattern of AI-COM-06)
- Progression helper: `nextLevel(level)` / `unlockThreshold = 0.7`

---

#### BLOOM-02 — Learning Objective Contract

**User Story:**
As a Backend engineer, I want learning objectives represented by a strict schema with measurable verbs so that vague objectives never enter the competency pipeline.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 2
**Story Points:** 2
**Day:** 1–2

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `LearningObjective`: `{objectiveId, topicId, knowledgeType, bloomLevel, verb, text}` (Node validator + Pydantic)
- Validation rejects: verbs not in the level's verb map, non-measurable phrasings ("know", "be familiar with"), empty text
- Objective text ≤ 200 chars; verb must appear at/near the start of `text`
- Rejected objectives logged for curation, never silently dropped

---

#### BLOOM-03 — Knowledge Extraction Job Type

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want a `study.knowledge.extract` job type on the bus so that objective extraction runs through the same reliable pipeline as every other AI operation.

**Domain:** AI

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 1
**Story Points:** 1
**Day:** 2

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-02, AI-COM-06

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Type registered in `AI_JOB_TYPES` (Node envelope + Python mirror) and topology constants
- Input contract: `{documentId, courseId, contentRef}` — raw content loaded from storage, never inline in the envelope
- Orchestrator declares work/DLQ/delay queues for the type at boot (existing ensureTopologyForType flow)

---

#### BLOOM-04 — Objective Extraction Stage

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want ingestion to extract concepts and draft measurable learning objectives from course content so that every document produces assessable targets.

**Domain:** AI
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 2–3

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-03, INGEST-06

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Extraction stage inserted between enrich and chunk in the ingestion pipeline (INGEST-06 amended)
- LLM prompt hardened via shared `prompt_guard` (course content = untrusted data); output strictly per BLOOM-02 schema
- Deduplication: identical `(topicId, normalized text)` objectives are merged, not duplicated
- Cap per document (e.g., ≤ 40 objectives) to bound cost; truncation reported in job result
- Extraction failure degrades gracefully: ingestion completes without objectives, warning emitted

---

#### BLOOM-05 — Bloom Classification & Confidence Gate

**User Story:**

**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 3

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-04

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Classification output validated against BLOOM-01 enums; illegal values → one correction retry → FAILED (sanitized)
- Verb-map consistency check: classifier's level must agree with the objective's verb; disagreement lowers confidence
- `confidence < 0.6` → objective stored but marked `needsReview`, excluded from plan targeting until curated
- Regression fixtures: one example per (level × knowledge type) cell asserted in tests

---

#### BLOOM-06 — LearningObjective Persistence

**User Story:**
As a Backend engineer, I want objectives persisted with indexes and document versioning so that lookups are fast and re-ingestion doesn't duplicate history.

**Domain:** Backend
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 2
**Story Points:** 2
**Day:** 4

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-05

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mongo collection `learning_objectives`; indexes: `(topicId, bloomLevel)`, `documentId`, unique `(topicId, textHash)`
- Re-ingestion of a document supersedes (version bump) rather than duplicating objectives
- TTL-free: objectives live until superseded or topic deleted

---

#### BLOOM-07 — CompetencyProfile Model & Estimator

**User Story:**
As an AI engineer, I want a per-student competency profile keyed by (topic × knowledgeType × bloomLevel) with an evidence-weighted estimator so that mastery reflects demonstrated cognition over time, not one grade.

**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 4–5

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-02, AI-COM-07

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Model shape: `{userId, topicId, knowledgeType, bloomLevel, score (0–1), confidence (0–1), evidence[], updatedAt}`; compound index on `(userId, topicId)`
- Estimator: evidence-weighted EWMA seeded by EVAL's smoothing guard; updates bounded to [0,1]; recency decay documented
- **No cross-level inference**: scoring "Understand" never moves "Create" (progression only via BLOOM-10 gate + evidence)
- Property-based unit tests: bounds, monotonicity under consistent evidence, convergence, decay
- Aggregation endpoint-ready: subject-level rollup computed from topic-level rows (topic granularity is the source of truth)

---

#### BLOOM-08 — Profile Updater (result-event consumer)

**User Story:**

- `GET /api/v1/competencies/topics/:topicId` → detail incl. evidence excerpts + `needsReview` flags hidden from students
- Auth-scoped: userId always from token; caching headers/Redis per PERF patterns (short TTL)
- OpenAPI/schema documented; pagination not required (bounded per user)

---

#### BLOOM-10 — Planner Integration (weakest-first targeting)

**User Story:**
As a User, I want generated plans to target my weakest competencies at the right cognitive level so that studying actually moves my profile up the taxonomy ladder.

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Hours:** 3
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 6

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-09, PLAN-06

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Planner input enriched with top-K weakest competencies + their unlocked levels
- Progression gate: level N activities only when level N−1 ≥ 0.7 (BLOOM-01 constant)
- Tasks carry `objectiveId` + `targetBloomLevel` (PLAN-04 schema already amended); fallback planner emits tasks WITHOUT them (graceful degradation)
- Deterministic tie-breaking so identical profiles produce stable plans

---

As a QA Engineer, I want an end-to-end test proving material → objectives → evaluation → profile → targeted plan so that the feedback loop is regression-proof.

**Domain:** Testing
**Type:** Test
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 5
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 8

**Dependencies:** BLOOM-10, BLOOM-11

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Contract tests: bloom-fixture parity both sides (extends TEST-04 suite)
- Integration: ingest sample doc (LLM mocked) → objectives classified → eval steps update profile idempotently (duplicate replay = no double-count) → plan targets weakest
- Playwright happy path: student sees updated radar after session; negative: no objectives extracted → plan still generates (degraded mode)
- Estimator property tests wired into CI (bounds/monotonicity/decay)
- **Future extension (KG-RAG-14):** Graph RAG E2E will extend this to verify knowledge graph population and prerequisite-aware plan generation
- Estimator property tests wired into CI (bounds/monotonicity/decay)

As the Planner agent, I want to use Graph RAG when generating study plans so that prerequisite chains are respected (student can't study Topic B before mastering prerequisite Topic A) and Bloom-level progression is followed.

**Domain:** Planner
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 6
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 6

**Dependencies:** KG-RAG-03, KG-RAG-07, PLAN-07

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Planner agent calls `GraphRAGClient.retrieve_prerequisite_chain(concept_id)` before scheduling a concept
- Plan generation respects prerequisite mastery: concept is only scheduled if all hard prerequisites have mastery_score >= 0.7
- Bloom-level ordering enforced: lower-order concepts before higher-order within the same topic
- Integration test: generate plan for a student with known gaps → plan includes remediation for prerequisite gaps before advancing
- Graceful degradation: if KG is unavailable, fall back to flat RAG + warning log (no hard failure)

#### KG-RAG-09 — Evaluator Agent RAG Integration

**User Story:**
As the Evaluator agent, I want to use Graph RAG (Reference Answers + Misconception KB + Student KG) when grading responses so that I can provide diagnosis-level feedback, not just correct/incorrect.

**Domain:** Evaluator
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 8
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 6

**Dependencies:** KG-RAG-03, KG-RAG-05, KG-RAG-06, KG-RAG-07, EVAL-06

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Evaluator retrieves reference answer via `ReferenceAnswerStore.get_reference_answer(question_id)` before grading
- After grading, evaluator retrieves likely misconceptions via `GraphRAGClient.retrieve_misconceptions(concept_id)` if student answer is incorrect
- Evaluation output includes: `diagnosis` (misconception_id, corrective_explanation, prerequisite_gap_concept_id)
- Student Mastery updated: `StudentKGClient.update_mastery(student_id, concept_id, score, bloom_level_earned)`
- Integration test: student answers incorrectly → evaluator returns misconception diagnosis + prerequisite gap → student mastery updated

---

#### KG-RAG-10 — Coach Agent RAG Integration

**User Story:**
As the Coach agent, I want to use Graph RAG (Student KG + Pedagogical KB + Misconception KB) when providing explanations so that I can tailor explanations to the student's specific gaps and misconceptions.

**Domain:** Coach
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Hours:** 8
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 7

**Dependencies:** KG-RAG-03, KG-RAG-07, COACH-09

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Coach retrieves student mastery state and prerequisite gaps before generating explanation
- Explanation adapts: if prerequisite gap detected, coach includes prerequisite review before the target concept
- If misconception detected in evaluation, coach provides corrective explanation referencing the misconception KB
- Coach history (past explanations, outcomes) stored for future similar-situation retrieval
- Integration test: student has prerequisite gap → coach explanation includes prerequisite review; student has misconception → coach addresses it

---

#### KG-RAG-11 — Search Agent Personal Corpus RAG

**User Story:**
As the Search agent, I want to include the student's ingested course materials in search results so that searches are grounded in the student's actual curriculum, not generic knowledge.

**Domain:** Search
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Hours:** 6
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 7

**Dependencies:** KG-RAG-03, SEARCH-05, INGEST-05

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Search agent's retrieval pipeline includes course-ingested documents (already in vector store) AND knowledge graph subgraph for the query concept
- Hybrid retrieval: flat kNN (existing) + graph traversal (new) → merged and re-ranked results
- Results tagged with source: "course-material" vs "reference" for transparency
- Integration test: student queries a topic from their course → results include course-specific content + graph-linked prerequisites

---

#### KG-RAG-12 — Reflection Agent RAG

**User Story:**
As the Reflection agent, I want to retrieve past reflections, their outcomes, and correlated learning patterns so that I can generate richer insights and identify recurring themes.

**Domain:** Reflection
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Hours:** 6
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 8

**Dependencies:** KG-RAG-03, REFLECTION-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Reflection agent stores each reflection summary in vector store with student_id, session_id, themes, mood tags
- New retrieval: `ReflectionRAGClient.retrieve_similar_reflections(student_id, themes, k=5)`
- Past reflections surfaced to the reflection prompt as context
- Outcome correlation: if reflection theme X was addressed, track whether subsequent session performance improved
- Integration test: generate reflection → store → generate second reflection → verify first is surfaced as context

---

#### KG-RAG-13 — Graph RAG Observability & Monitoring

**User Story:**
As an SRE, I want observability hooks on all Graph RAG retrieval calls (traversal depth, latency, hit rate, fallback usage) so that I can monitor performance and detect degradation.

**Domain:** Observability
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Hours:** 4
**Story Points:** 3
**Day:** 8

**Dependencies:** KG-RAG-03, OPS-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All GraphRAGClient methods emit structured logs: concept_id, traversal_depth, latency_ms, result_count, fallback_used
- Prometheus metrics: `graph_rag_traversal_latency_seconds`, `graph_rag_hit_count`, `graph_rag_fallback_total`
- Dashboard panel in Grafana showing Graph RAG health
- Alert: fallback rate > 20% over 5 minutes triggers warning

---

#### KG-RAG-14 — Graph RAG Integration Tests & Load Test

**User Story:**
As a QA engineer, I want end-to-end integration tests and a load test for the full Graph RAG pipeline (extraction → graph population → retrieval → agent integration) so that we verify correctness and performance under realistic conditions.

**Domain:** Testing
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Hours:** 6
**Story Points:** 5
**Day:** 9

**Dependencies:** KG-RAG-08, KG-RAG-09, KG-RAG-10, TEST-01

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration test: ingest course content → extraction populates graph → student answers question → evaluator uses graph RAG → coach uses graph RAG → verify full pipeline
- Load test: 100 concurrent retrieval requests, p95 latency < 1s
- Regression test: graph RAG fallback does not break existing flat RAG behavior
- CI wiring: tests run on every PR touching `services/knowledge_graph/` or `services/graph_rag/`

---

#### KG-RAG-15 — Documentation & Runbook

**User Story:**
As a team member, I want comprehensive documentation for the Knowledge Graph & Graph RAG system so that onboarding and debugging are efficient.

## 18. Team Workload Projection

### Assumptions

- 3 developers (Dev A — Backend, Dev B — AI, Dev C — Frontend/QA/DevOps)
- Each developer works ~4–5 hours/day on stories
- F01 is the shared foundation; all developers touch it in Sprint 1
- F10 (Testing) runs in parallel every sprint; TEST-01/02/03 are early so the suite is trustworthy before features land

### Sprint 1 (Days 1–5): AI Foundation — F01 + F10 kickoff

| Developer | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Total |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Dev A** | AI-COM-02 (contract) 3h | AI-COM-04 (publisher) 4h | AI-COM-07 (persistence) 4h | AI-COM-07 1h + PLAN-02 2h | PLAN-01 3h (contract partner) | 13h |
| **Dev B** | AI-COM-03 3h (result contract) | AI-COM-05 (consumer framework) 5h | AI-COM-06 (retry/DLQ) 3h | AI-COM-06 2h + AI-COM-08 3h | PLAN-03 (prompt isolation) 5h | 13h |
| **Dev C** | AI-COM-01 (RabbitMQ infra) 4h | AI-COM-09 (network isolation) 2h + TEST-01 3h | TEST-02 1h + TEST-03 (hybrid fixture) 3h | TEST-04 (contract tests) 3h | AI-COM-10 (comm test) 4h + TEST-14 1h | 14h |

**Sprint 1 gate:** AI-COM-10 green — one real AI job round-trips through RabbitMQ.

### Sprint 2 (Days 1–5): AI Features + Security

| Developer | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Total |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

### Critical path (the dependency chain that must not slip)

```
AI-COM-01 → AI-COM-02 → AI-COM-04/05 → AI-COM-10 (Sprint 1 gate)
   → PLAN-01..08 → PLAN-10 (Sprint 2)
   → TEST-11 → TEST-12 (Sprint 3-4 gate)
   → INFRA-09 → INFRA-11 → INFRA-12 (Sprint 4-5 deploy)
```

### F14 insertion (added v1.1)

The Bloom Competency Engine (~44 h, 13 stories) was added after the v1.0 scope was frozen. Scheduling options:

- **Recommended: Sprint 6** — the competency loop only delivers value once INGEST (Sprint 3) and EVAL (Sprint 2) produce evidence
- **Alternative:** BLOOM-01/02/DOC (contracts, zero deps) slot into spare capacity immediately; BLOOM-10/11 are Medium priority and deferrable to post-MVP if Sprint 6 slips
- The loop closes back into F02: BLOOM-10 makes "personalized plan" measurable — do not market personalization until it ships

### F15 insertion (added v1.2)

The Knowledge Graph & Graph RAG Infrastructure (~100 h, 15 stories) was added to cover advanced retrieval needs identified across all AI agents. Scheduling options:

- **Recommended: Sprint 7** — KG-RAG depends on F05/INGEST (Sprint 3) for entity extraction triggers, BLOOM (Sprint 6) for mastery data, and EVAL (Sprint 2) for reference answers
- **Early start:** KG-RAG-01 (schema) and KG-RAG-04/05 (Pedagogical KB, Misconception KB) can start in Sprint 6 alongside BLOOM since they share Bloom data
- **Critical path:** KG-RAG-01 → KG-RAG-02 → KG-RAG-03 → KG-RAG-08/09/10 (agent integrations) → KG-RAG-14 (E2E tests)
- The Graph RAG layer is the single most impactful capability upgrade: it transforms flat kNN retrieval into relation-aware subgraph retrieval for Planner, Evaluator, Coach, and Search agents

## 19. Shared Foundation

The RabbitMQ AI job infrastructure (F01) is the single most important shared artifact. Every AI feature depends on it.

### Shared Node artifacts (`study-partner-api/shared/`)

| Artifact | Purpose | Consumers |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `ai-messaging/publisher.js` | AI-COM-04 publisher (envelope + reconnect) | ai-orchestrator, study, auth (for events) |
| `ai-messaging/envelope.js` | AI-COM-02/03 envelope validation | all producers/consumers |
| `ai-messaging/dlq-replay.js` | AI-COM-06 DLQ replay ops tool | ai-orchestrator operators |
| `bloom/taxonomy.js` | BLOOM-01 taxonomy enums + verb maps | ai-orchestrator, study, web |
| `middleware/internalAuth.js` | SEC-05 internal-service auth | all services |
| `middleware/asyncHandler.js` | STUDY-01 async wrapping | all services |
| `utils/awardXp.js` | GAME-03 unified XP event publisher | study, user-profile |
| `config/envValidator.js` | SEC-06 fail-fast secret validation | all services |

### Shared Python artifacts (`study-partner-ai/`)

| Artifact | Purpose | Consumers |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `workers/base.py` | AI-COM-05 `BaseAIWorker` | Planner/Coach/Evaluator/Search/Ingestion/Knowledge workers |
| `messaging/envelope.py` | AI-COM-02/03 Pydantic envelope | all workers |

| `db/client.py` | shared async Mongo client | all agents |
| `vector/embedder.py` | shared SentenceTransformer singleton | planner + ingestion |
| `knowledge_graph/schema.py` | KG-RAG-01 graph schema definitions | knowledge graph, all agents |
| `knowledge_graph/extractor.py` | KG-RAG-02 entity/relation extraction | ingestion pipeline |
| `graph_rag/client.py` | KG-RAG-03 shared Graph RAG client | planner, evaluator, coach, search, reflection |

### Sequencing rules

1. **F01 before F02–F05** — no AI feature migrates until AI-COM-10 passes
2. **TEST-01/02/03 before feature work lands** — the suite must be trustworthy first
3. **SEC-01..04 before GA** — token/OTP security are P0
4. **INFRA-01..03 before any deploy** — security scans must block
